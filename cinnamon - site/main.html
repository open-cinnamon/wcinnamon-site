          Wide Cinnamon is a virtual environment.<br />
          It uses your system to create a subsystem that is isolated from your
          root system.<br />
          Most applications are coded in GDScript for better compatibility
          across systems, but other methods can also be explored.<br />
          Wide Cinnamon is based on Godot 4.3 with C# support.<br />
          However, this does not mean you can only use C# for your own projects.
          A significant part of Wide Cinnamon is written in C#, while some
          built-in tools are developed in GDScript.<br />
          The main goal of Wide Cinnamon is to provide seamless connectivity
          between different systems.
